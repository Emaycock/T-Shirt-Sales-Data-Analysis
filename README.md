Project Overview
This project involves analyzing t-shirt sales data from three different datasets: Customer Data, Sales Data, and Product Data. The goal of the analysis was to uncover trends in sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability. I cleaned and transformed the data using SQL and Python, visualized the insights using Tableau, and drafted business recommendations based on the findings.

Datasets
The project consists of the following three datasets:

Customer Data: Information about customers, including their demographics and membership status.
Sales Data: Records of individual sales transactions, including the date, item, quantity, price, and customer ID.
Product Data: Information about the products, such as product type (e.g., shirt or hoodie), size, color, material, etc.
Data Cleaning and Transformation
SQL
Data Cleaning:
I cleaned the datasets by removing any duplicates and handling missing values.
Standardized and normalized data where necessary (e.g., consistent formats for dates, prices, etc.).
Data Joining:
I joined two of the three tables (Sales Data and Product Data) in SQL based on a shared field, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of sales trends and product characteristics.
Python & Pandas
After the initial data cleaning, I used Python and the Pandas library for further analysis.
I performed operations like:
Grouping and aggregating data to identify top-selling products, customer preferences, and product profitability.
Calculating metrics such as the number of items returned or exchanged, the number of sales by product category (e.g., color, material, type), and the total revenue generated from each product type.
Analyzing customer behavior, including identifying which customers were rewards members and which had the highest purchasing patterns.
Data Analysis & Insights
Using the cleaned data, I uncovered several key business insights:

Top Products: I identified the most profitable items based on sales performance, including factors such as product type (shirt or hoodie), color, material, and size.
Returns & Exchanges: I analyzed which items were returned or exchanged the most, providing insights into potential quality issues or customer dissatisfaction.
Rewards Members: I examined the purchasing behavior of customers who were rewards members versus non-members, identifying trends and opportunities for customer loyalty programs.
Product Trends: Through aggregating and analyzing data, I determined which product categories (e.g., color, size, material) were the most popular among customers, helping businesses target the right inventory mix.
Data Visualization
I used Tableau to visualize the results of my analysis and create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the following:

Sales performance by product type, color, material, and size.
Customer behavior trends, including purchases by rewards members.
Product return/exchange rates.
Insights into the most and least profitable items.
Tools & Technologies Used
SQL for data cleaning and joining datasets.
Python (Pandas) for data analysis and trend identification.
Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and creating visualizations with Python.
